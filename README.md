# E-Store

A small Java-based e-store program developed during my 2nd semester.

## Overview

E-Store is a console-based application that simulates an online store. The program is structured using several classes, including `Supply`, `Order`, and `Sale`, to manage products, orders, and sales respectively.

- **File Reading:**  
  The `Supply.java` class reads product data from a text file (e.g., `products.txt`), demonstrating basic file I/O operations in Java.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The program makes use of try-catch blocks to gracefully handle exceptions, particularly for file reading and writing operations.
